# CIS 200 Program 2

This forms GUI app uses the same class hierarchy from Program 1 for Parcels and Letters. It loads some of these by default and includes subforms to create new Letters or Parcels, accessible through the menu bar, as well as options for displaying the existing objects.

This is the second of four programs written for CIS 200: Software Development II
